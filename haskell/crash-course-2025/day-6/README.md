# Day 6 - Haskell Maze Game

There are two versions of this game:

- **`maze-v1.hs`**: The stable version.\
  It is complete and works well. It uses standard list logic.
- **`maze-v2.hs`**: The new version.\
  It uses a custom `Parser` and advanced types like `Functor` and `Monad`.

## How to Play

### Version 1 (Stable / Baseline)

This version runs the original game logic.

```bash
./run-maze-v1.md
# OR if you are in the root folder:

```

**To quit the game:** Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.

### Version 2 (New Parser)
